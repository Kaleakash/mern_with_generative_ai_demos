# My React App

This project is a simple React application that dynamically generates directory structures based on user input. It utilizes a machine learning model, `MyStructureGenModel`, to create application structures for different types of applications such as web and mobile.

## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

```
my-react-app
├── public
│   ├── index.html        # Main HTML file for the React application
│   └── favicon.ico       # Favicon for the application
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── App.js        # Main React component that handles user input
│   ├── models
│   │   └── MyStructureGenModel.js  # Model for generating application structures
│   ├── utils
│   │   └── generateAppStructure.js  # Utility function to generate app structure
│   ├── index.js          # Entry point for the React application
│   └── App.css           # CSS styles for the App component
├── package.json           # npm configuration file
├── .gitignore             # Files and directories to ignore by Git
└── README.md              # Documentation for the project
```

## Features

- **Dynamic Directory Generation**: Users can input the type of application structure they want to generate (web, mobile, or custom).
- **Console Output**: The generated directory structure is displayed in the console.
- **React Components**: The application is built using React, making it easy to manage state and user interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Usage

- Enter the type of application structure you want to generate in the input field.
- Click the button to generate the structure.
- The generated directory structure will be displayed in the console.
